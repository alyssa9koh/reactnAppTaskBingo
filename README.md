# React Native Task Bingo App

Idea by my friend Catherine

Idea: Input a bunch of tasks. The app will generate a bingo board. You can either clear the board as you complete tasks, or, when you complete a task, a new task will regenerate under it.

## Basic features

### Start a bingo board

### Add tasks to a bingo board

### Share bingo board as an image
Allow the user to share the bingo board and current process by saving as an image that goes into the user's camera roll.

## Additional features (ideas for now)

* Share buttons to Twitter, Instagram, etc.
* If there are more tasks left, a new task pops up after completion of a task

## Progress tracker

* Project start: 26 March 2024
* Basic repo setup: 7 June 2024
* Basic bingo board created: 7 June 2024
